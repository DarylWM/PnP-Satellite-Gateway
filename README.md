# PnP-Satellite-Gateway

The PnP-Satellite-Gateway is a combination of off-the-shelf hardware and custom software I wrote to solve the problem of not being to self-spot on Parks'n'Peaks (PnP) from the top of a mountain (SOTA) or from a remote National Park (WWFF/POTA) that is outside coverage of the mobile phone network. Rather than sending an SMS to the PnP SMS gateway, an operator can use their Garmin inReach to send a message to the PnP-Satellite-Gateway running on a SBC such as the Raspberry Pi or the Jetson Nano sitting on their desk at home, snugly within the mobile phone network and also on the operator's internet connection. Attached to the SBC is an 4G LTE board. The 4G LTE connection is enabled by a SIM that provides authorisation to connect to the carrier's network.
